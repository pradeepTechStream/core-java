Logging :
-Logging is the process of writing log messages during the execution of a program to a central place.
-Logging allows you to report and persist error,warning,info messages so that the messages can later be retrieved and analyzed.
-The object which performs the logging in applications is typically just called Logger.

How to create Logger :
static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(CurrentClass.class.getName())
-CurrentClass : class name for which we are creating Logger.
-Every class has its own logger object.
-Log4j provides the factory method to get Logger objects.
-We use Logger’s methods to generate log statements.

Loggers Method :
-nfo(),debug(),warn(),fatal(),error()
-all method print message only.

Levels:
-Level is a class in the org.apache.log4j.* package.
-We can also create Custom level.
-Each level has a different priority order like:
-debug < info < warn < error < fatal.
-In addition to that you also have the levels OFF and ALL to turn the logging off or to log everything.
-LOGGER.setLevel(Level.INFO);

Appender
-Appender is used to write messages into a file or Console or DB
-Log4j has different types of appenders:
	-FileAppender.
	-ConsoleAppender.
	-JDBCAppender.
Layout
-This is used to define the formatting in which logs will print in a repository.
-We have different types of layouts:
	-PatternLayout
	-SimpleLayout
	-XMLLayout
	-HTMLLayout

Configuration :log4j.application
-load required jar file : log4j , common-logging.
-create log4j.properties file in src folder.
-add property in properties file.
